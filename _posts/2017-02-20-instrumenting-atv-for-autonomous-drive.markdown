This project was done in autumn of 2013 as part of a university project. The goal was to make electrical all terrain vehicle ready for autonomous drive. This included installing on board computer, odometry, gas pedal control and steering control. I was part of the group that installed onboard computer and implemented gas pedal control. I will add pictures of the project later here.
