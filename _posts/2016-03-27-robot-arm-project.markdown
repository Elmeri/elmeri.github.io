This week I started a robotic arm project. There are 2 reasons for this, both professional and just wanting to have fun. I got my inspiration for this project from my Master's Thesis which is about acceptance testing of embeddded systems. This has involved studying all things related to embedded systems which has got me excited on the subject. Another reason is to have a robot arm in my living room! How cool is that.

I stumbled upon this [lifehacker article](http://lifehacker.com/build-a-kickass-robot-arm-the-perfect-arduino-project-1700643747). The robotic arm has simple design and looking through the instructions it seemed simple enough for me to try. I also have an Arduino Leonardo already and some experience building projects with it. The article also links to [instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/Pocket-Sized-Robot-Arm-meArm-V04/) which is always a plus.

The materials seemed simple as well, Arduino, breadboard, a potentiometer, some wires and 470µF capacitor. For the arm itself, 4 servos, 1 servo extension cable, the parts for the actual arm itself and 4 rubber feet. It is possible to buy the entire kit, but I chose to try and build it myself. This week, I ordered 4 hobby servos [TowerPro SG90 9G Mini Servo](http://www.servodatabase.com/servo/towerpro/sg90) from dealextreme. I'm a bit worried on the durability, but we will see.

While waiting for servos, the parts for the arm itself should be made. The parts could be 3d-printed, laser cutter or carved from wood. I haven't decided on material yet, but 3d-printing sounds like a good options. I haven't 3d-printed anything yet so this would be good practice.

I also need to get my hands on the potetiometer, capacitor, server extension cable, rubber feet and a breadboard. The servos should arrive in about two weeks. I will write more then.
