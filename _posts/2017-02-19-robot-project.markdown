This is about robot challenge project with 3 friends of mine. The robot challenge is organized by company we work in, Eficode. In the challenge participants are divided in to groups of four. The task is to build that robot that is able to survive 2 challenges and to make 1 bonus feature. First challenge is to follow a line in the ground. The second is to for the robot to survive out of labyrinth. Each team was given a starter pack which included Arduino Nano and differential wheeled robot chassis.

So far, we have constructed the chassis, connected arduino to motors and installed ultrasound and infrared sensors. Also, the line follow and random walking is ready. I'll update video from both operations later.
